          "Inscribed marble posts were used to mark the entrances to the Agora wherever a street led into the open square. Two have been found in situ, inscribed with the simple text \"I am the boundary of the Agora,\" in letters that should date somewhere around 500 B.C. (Figs. 23, 24). The limits of the square had to be well marked for two reasons. First, people who were underage or who had been convicted of certain crimes (e.g., mistreatment of parents, failure to show up for military duty, impiety) were not allowed into the Agora. Second, markers were needed to define what was public land, to prevent encroachment by private buildings. Figure 23. Agora boundary stone found east of the Tholos, ca. 500 B.C.  Figure 24. Agora boundary stone found deep under the Middle Stoa. Text, letter-forms, and tooling all indicate it is part of the same series as that in Figure 23, except all the letters and words run backward (retrograde), from right to left.  One such building, found just behind the northern boundary stone (horos, in Greek), produced bone eyelets and iron hobnails, suggesting that a cobbler worked here in the 5th century B.C., while a fragmentary drinking cup found nearby preserved the incised name of Simon (Figs. 25, 26). Diogenes Laertius records that Sokrates, when he wished to meet with those pupils too young to enter the Agora, would meet them at the shop of Simon the cobbler, which lay near the square. The evidence is circumstantial, but we may well have here the remains of one of Sokrates’ informal classrooms. Figure 25. The remains of the house of Simon the cobbler, 5th century B.C., built against the Agora boundary stone (bottom left).   Figure 26.

The Church of the Holy Apostles, because of its early date, was deemed worth preserving and, indeed, restoring (Figs. 67–70; for location, see Fig. 41). Dated to the years around A.D. 1000, the church underwent successive additions over the centuries, especially at the west end. The original plan is unique: a standard cross-in-square arrangement, but with apses at each of the four ends of the cross. The central dome is supported on four interior columns. The outer walls are adorned with decorative brickwork known as \"kufic\" (Arabic writing developed in the city of Kufa). The fragments of frescoes inside are of the 17th century, some from this building and the rest recovered from other churches in the area. Figure 67. Church of the Holy Apostles, ca. A.D. 1000.

          "Across the street from the Metroon lie the remains of the Monument of the Eponymous Heroes (Fig. 21). When Kleisthenes created the democracy in 508/7 B.C., he assigned all the Athenians to ten newly-formed tribes; he then sent 100 names of Athenian heroes to Delphi, where Apollo’s oracle picked ten, after whom the tribes were named. Citizenship depended on membership in a tribe, the army was arranged in tribal contingents, one served in the boule as a member of one’s tribe, and festivals were held in honor of one’s tribal hero; the tribal system was the foundation on which the new Athenian democracy was built. Figure 21. The Monument of the Eponymous Heroes, second half of the 4th century B.C. The monument took the form of a long base for the ten bronze statues representing the ten eponymous heroes of the tribes (Fig. 22). It served as a public notice board and announcements concerning citizens would be hung on the face of the high base beneath the appropriate tribal statue. Military conscription, public honors, upcoming legal events, and proposed legislation would all be displayed. In the days before radio, television, newspapers, and the telephone, the monument was essential for the dissemination of official information. Figure 22. Restored drawings of the Eponymous Heroes, second half of the 4th century B.C  Only parts of the stone sill and the surrounding fence survive, along with five limestone blocks from the base itself and two marble blocks from the crown. Literary references indicate that the Eponymoi were erected as early as 425 B.C., though the remains here go back no earlier than ca. 330 B.C. Cuttings in the sill show that the monument was refurbished on several occasions thereafter and these adjustments may well match changes in the tribal system itself. New tribes were created and new heroes added from time to time in order to flatter powerful rulers in the Hellenistic and Roman periods; the number of tribes -- and therefore heroes -- fluctuated between ten and thirteen.\"Higher up stand statues of heroes, from whom the tribes at Athens later took their names. Who fixed the number of tribes at ten instead of four and gave them new names instead of the old ones -- all this is related by Herodotos. Amongst the Eponymoi -- for that is what they call them -- are Hippothoon, son of Poseidon and. . . .\" (Pausanias 1.5)",

          "Inscribed marble posts were used to mark the entrances to the Agora wherever a street led into the open square. Two have been found in situ, inscribed with the simple text \"I am the boundary of the Agora,\" in letters that should date somewhere around 500 B.C. (Figs. 23, 24). The limits of the square had to be well marked for two reasons. First, people who were underage or who had been convicted of certain crimes (e.g., mistreatment of parents, failure to show up for military duty, impiety) were not allowed into the Agora. Second, markers were needed to define what was public land, to prevent encroachment by private buildings. Figure 23. Agora boundary stone found east of the Tholos, ca. 500 B.C.  Figure 24. Agora boundary stone found deep under the Middle Stoa. Text, letter-forms, and tooling all indicate it is part of the same series as that in Figure 23, except all the letters and words run backward (retrograde), from right to left.  One such building, found just behind the northern boundary stone (horos, in Greek), produced bone eyelets and iron hobnails, suggesting that a cobbler worked here in the 5th century B.C., while a fragmentary drinking cup found nearby preserved the incised name of Simon (Figs. 25, 26). Diogenes Laertius records that Sokrates, when he wished to meet with those pupils too young to enter the Agora, would meet them at the shop of Simon the cobbler, which lay near the square. The evidence is circumstantial, but we may well have here the remains of one of Sokrates’ informal classrooms. Figure 25. The remains of the house of Simon the cobbler, 5th century B.C., built against the Agora boundary stone (bottom left).   Figure 26.

It consists of a large square room and a paved courtyard, surrounded by three stoas that had shops behind their colonnades. As a cultural and educational building, the library reflects the role of Athens as the principal university town of the Roman empire. The dedicator, Titus Flavius Pantainos, was the son of the head of a philosophical school and refers to himself as a priest of the philosophical muses. A second inscription preserves the library rules: \"No book is to be taken out because we have sworn an oath. [The library] is to be open from the first hour until the sixth\" (Fig. 45). Figure 43. Plan of the Library of Pantainos, ca. A.D. 100.   Figure 44. The north stoa of the Library of Pantainos, looking east toward the Gate of Athena.   Figure 45. Rules of the Library of Pantainos: \"No book is to be taken out because we have sworn an oath. (The library) is to be open from the first hour until the sixth.\"  The northern stoa runs eastward, along the south side of a marble street that led in Roman times from the Agora to the Doric gateway of the market of Caesar and Augustus, also known as the Roman Agora. Destroyed by the Herulians in A.D. 267, the northern stoa was eventually rebuilt as part of a new large two-storeyed structure in the 5th century A.D. (Fig. 46), and the western stoa of the library was incorporated into the Late Roman fortification. Figure 46.

          "The appearance of the south side of the Agora was radically changed during the 2nd century B.C. with the construction of several new buildings. This South Square, as it is called, was made up of two long stoas with a third building linking them (Fig. 38). Of the Classical buildings, the Aiakeion and Southwest Fountain House were incorporated, South Stoa I was demolished, and the Southeast Fountain House and Mint were left out. The new square can best be understood from the so-called East Building, just north of the Church of the Holy Apostles. Figure 38. Cutaway view of the South Square, 2nd century B.C. First to be built was the Middle Stoa, which ran east–west across the old square, dividing it into two unequal halves and obscuring one of the original boundary stones at its western end. At just under 150 meters long, it is the largest building in the Agora, with colonnades at both north and south as well as down the middle. Traces of a narrow parapet that ran between some of the columns can be made out on individual drums. The original steps and three columns remain in situ at its eastern end; to the west, only the heavy foundations of reddish conglomerate survive. Except for its size the stoa is a relatively modest building, made of limestone, with a terracotta roof (Fig. 39). It was built between ca. 180 and 140 B.C. Figure 39.

          "The area of the northwest corner is where the Panathenaic Way, leading from the main gate of Athens, the Dipylon, entered the Agora square (Figs. 58, 59). This was accordingly the appropriate place for Herms, primitive markers used by the Athenians to mark all entrances. These took the form of rectangular shafts of marble with a set of male genitalia carved halfway up and a likeness of the god Hermes at the top. Several dozen examples of these very conservative monuments have been found in the excavations in this area, ranging in date from the early 5th century B.C. to the 2nd century A.D. (Fig. 60).\"Menekles or Kallikrates in his work on Athens writes, 'From the Stoa Poikile and the Stoa Basileios extend the so-called Herms.

          "Late in the 1st century B.C. the Athenians were given money for a new marketplace by Caesar and Augustus, and the northern half of the old Agora square was filled with two new structures, the Odeion of Agrippa and the Temple of Ares.A large concert hall or odeion was given to the Athenians by Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa, the son-in-law and general of Augustus, in the years around 15 B.C. It was a huge two-storeyed structure that must have dominated the square (Fig. 52). The auditorium, with its raised stage and marble-paved orchestra, seated about 1,000 spectators. It was surrounded on three sides by a cryptoporticus (subterranean colonnaded hall) at the lower level, with stoas above. The exterior of the building was elaborated with Corinthian pilasters. Entry to the Odeion was either from the upper level of the Middle Stoa on the south or through a modest porch at ground level on the north (Fig. 53). Figure 52. Cross section of the Odeion, 1st phase (late 1st century B.C.), looking east.   Figure 53. Ground plan of the Odeion of Agrippa, 1st phase. (late 1st century B.C.)  The great open span of the auditorium (25 meters) eventually proved too great and the roof collapsed in the years around A.D. 150. The structure was rebuilt as a lecture hall, with the seating capacity reduced to about 500, and a far more elaborate facade was built at the north, using massive pillars carved in the form of giants (snaky tales) and tritons (fishy tails) (Fig. 54). Figure 54. Giant from the facade of the 2nd phase (ca. A.D. 150–175), as reused in the early 5th century A.C.  \"The lecture was interrupted by much shouting and laughter. Philagros shouted and screamed that they were treating him badly in preventing him from using his own material; but he was not acquitted on a charge which was now well established. All this took place in the Agrippeion.\" (Philostratos, Lives of the Sophists 597)The loss of this odeion for concerts presumably prompted Herodes Atticus to build his handsome new odeion on the south slopes of the Acropolis in the years around A.D. 160.The Odeion of Agrippa was destroyed by the Herulians in A.D. 267. It was rebuilt in the early 5th century A.D. as part of a sprawling complex, perhaps a palace, with numerous rooms, a bath, and several courtyards, which extended southward all the way across the old South Square (Fig. 55). The Giants and Tritons were reused for a monumental entranceway, and their present position on high piers dates to this last phase of the building. Figure 55.

          "Numerous roads led in and out of the Agora square. By far the most important, however, was the broad street known as the Dromos or Panathenaic Way, the principal thoroughfare of the city (Fig. 4). It led from the main city gate, the Dipylon, up to the Acropolis, a distance of just over a kilometer, and served as the processional way for the great parade that was a highlight of the Panathenaic festival. Halfway along, it enters the Agora at its northwest corner and passes through the square on a diagonal, exiting at the southeast corner. Figure 4. Model of the Agora and northwest Athens in the 2nd century A.C., looking along the entire course of the Panathenaic Way from the Dipylon Gate (bottom) to the Acropolis (top); view from the northwest.  The street is unpaved except to the south, as it begins the steep ascent to the Acropolis, where it was paved with large stone slabs in the Roman period. Elsewhere it is made up of layers of packed gravel; at the north, some sixty-six superimposed layers were excavated, reflecting a thousand years of use of the thoroughfare, from the 6th century B.C. until the 6th century A.D.The line of the street was defined in the Hellenistic and Roman periods by successive open stone gutters along its south side (Fig.5). Basins in the line of the channel caught sediment and helped keep the channel clean; those off to the side presumably provided water for draft animals. Figure 5. Limestone channel with water basins along the Panathenaic Way.  The street was used not only for the procession, but also for chariot races (the apobates) during the Panathenaic festival (Fig. 6). It seems also to have served as the running track for foot races before a proper stadium was built, and as the training ground for the young recruits of the Athenian cavalry. Figure 6. Sculpted base for a monument celebrating a victory in the apobates at the Panathenaic Games, 4th century B.C. As the race made its way along the Panathenaic Way, the armed passenger was expected to jump on and off the moving chariot.  ",

The wall was constructed in the years following the sack of Athens by the Herulians in A.D. 267; it starts at the Acropolis with a new gate, runs north down the east side of the roadway, takes in the ruins of the Stoa of Attalos, and then turns eastward toward the Library of Hadrian. The old Agora, former center of town, is not even within the fortified limits of the Late Roman town, which lay to the east.The wall is made up almost entirely of reused architectural pieces taken from buildings and monuments destroyed by the Herulians: marble architrave blocks, Ionic and Doric columns, inscriptions, and statue bases were all used to make two solid faces, while the interior was filled with rubble. Square towers, now largely dismantled, projected from the face of the wall at regular intervals. Figure 42. Late Roman Fortification Wall, ca.

          "On the west side, lying just south of the Panathenaic Way, are the remains of the Royal Stoa (Stoa Basileios), one of the earliest and most important of the public buildings of Athens (Figs. 61, 62). It served as the headquarters of the archon basileus (king archon), second in command of the Athenian government and the official responsible for religious matters and the laws. Here, inscribed copies of the full law code of Athens were on display, the annual oath of office was administered to all those about to serve the democracy (Fig. 63), and Sokrates was indicted for impiety in 399 B.C. The identification of the building is secure, thanks to Pausanias and two inscribed herm bases dedicated by king archons and found in situ on the steps of the building. Figure 61. Actual state plan of the Royal Stoa.  [Sokrates speaks]: \"I must now present myself at the Stoa Basileios to answer the indictment of Meletos, which he has brought against me.\" (Plato, Theaetetos 210d)The building is small for a stoa, only 18 meters long, with eight Doric columns across the front and four down the middle (Fig. 64). It should date originally to the years around 500 B.C., but was extensively rebuilt in the 5th century. Two projecting wings were added between 410 and 400 to display new copies of the law code of the city. Figure 62. Reconstruction of the Royal Stoa, as it would have appeared in ca. 300 B.C. \"[The archons] took the oath near the Stoa Basileios, on the stone on which were the pieces of the victims, swearing that they would guard the laws.\" (Pollux 8.86) Figure 63 (right).

The off-center doors indicate the placement of dining couches in the rooms, perhaps used by magistrates fed at public expense, and an inscription found in the building suggests that at least one room was used by the metronomoi, the officials in charge of weights and measures. Numerous coins found in the excavations also reflect the commercial function of the building. The stoa was dismantled in the middle years of the 2nd century B.C. to make way for South Stoa II.

The identification is based on a large terracotta pipeline that delivered water to the rear of the building from the east, and overflow channels designed to carry water away from the two side chambers (Fig. 35). The central hall is restored with a colonnaded facade. A date of ca. 530–520 B.C. is suggested by pottery found under the floor and the use of polygonal limestone masonry, with Ζ-clamps to join the blocks. The fountain is one of the earliest public buildings in the Agora, and the fact that water was piped to this specific spot suggests that the area was being deliberately developed to accommodate large numbers of people.In the 2nd century A.D. Pausanias identified this building as the Enneakrounos (nine-spouted) fountain, built in the 6th century B.C. by the tyrant Peisistratos, but Thucydides -- who presumably knew better -- locates that famous monument south of the Acropolis, below the sanctuary of Olympian Zeus.

They comprise several important monuments, though their state of preservation is poor. They are slightly more comprehensible if viewed from the ancient road that ran above them to the south.

A colonnade on two sides gave access to a large reservoir, the terminus of a long stone aqueduct that approached the building from the east, running under the south street. Low parapets set between columns allowed access to the water, delivered to the fountain by means of channels set within the thickness of the walls. One of the largest fountains of the city, the building is dated on the basis of pottery to the years around 350–325 B.C. Figure 30.

As in the American system, these courts had the final say as to the legality and interpretation of any law, and essentially represent the sovereign power of the state.The identification is based largely on the discovery of a container made of drain tiles set on end holding seven of the inscribed bronze ballots used by jurors to render their verdicts (Fig. 51).

          "Lining the east side of the Agora square is the Stoa of Attalos (Fig. 47), built during the reign of Attalos II of Pergamon (159–138 B.C.), who studied in Athens under the philosopher Karneades before becoming king. In a sense, this is a gift from a loyal alumnus, and what he gave the Athenians was a shopping mall. Double colonnades on two storeys provided shaded walkways in front of forty-two shops that were rented out by the city. White Pentelic and blue Hymettian marble were used, along with limestone for the walls. The facetting of the lower part of the outer colonnade reflects the intense use of the building; lots of people and goods will have passed through, rubbing and banging against the columns, so there was little point in fluting them at the level of potential damage and wear. The column capitals used upstairs for the inner colonnade are of an unusual type (\"Pergamene\"), a late adaptation of early Egyptian prototypes. Figure 47. Plans of the Stoa of Attalos, 159–138 B.C. The stoa served as the main commercial center for the Athenians for centuries; it was destroyed by the Herulians in A.D. 267 and then incorporated into the new fortification wall, which preserved its northern end up to roof level. It was fully restored in 1953–1956 (Figs. 48, 49) to serve as the site museum (separate guide). It houses storage facilities in the basement, a public display area on the ground floor, and offices and workrooms on the first floor. Parts of the original building were left or incorporated at the south end, so the visitor can check the validity of the restoration. The reconstruction demonstrates the effectiveness of the stoa as the ideal architectural form for a public building in Greece: the colonnaded walkways provide light and fresh air for literally thousands of people, while protecting them from the intense sun of summer or the wind and rain of winter.

Built of marble and limestone in the years around 425 B.C., the stoa had Doric columns on the exterior and Ionic columns within. According to Pausanias it was decorated with paintings done by Euphranor, a famous 4th-century artist, and the shields of those who died fighting for the freedom of Athens were displayed on the building. Rooms were added to the back of the stoa in the Early Roman period and may have housed a cult of the Roman emperors.",

          "Across modern Hadrian Street are the most recent excavations (2003), along the north side of the square. Here have been revealed the remains of another large stoa, identified on the basis of Pausanias as the Stoa Poikile (Painted Stoa). The stoa was of the Doric order outside, with Ionic columns inside, built mostly of limestone, with marble for the interior column capitals (Figs. 65, 66). Pottery suggests a date in the years around 470–460 B.C. for the construction. Figure 65. Cross section of the Stoa Poikile, with Doric columns outside, Ionic within; ca. 470–460 B.C.  Figure 66. Reconstructed drawing of the west end of the Stoa Poikile as it would have appeared in about 400 B.C. The Stoa Poikile, one of the most famous buildings of Athens, took its name from a series of handsome panel paintings that adorned it. Done by the best artists of Classical Greece, they were installed in the middle years of the 5th century B.C. Some 600 years later, in about A.D. 150, Pausanias could still describe four of them, showing Athenian military triumphs, both mythological and historical. Most famous, perhaps, was a picture of the battle of Marathon (490 B.C.) by Polygnotos. By A.D. 400 the paintings had disappeared, taken down by a Roman proconsul according to the Bishop Synesios, who was bitterly disappointed not to see them during his visit to Athens. Actual armor and weapons taken from defeated enemies were also displayed on the building to remind Athenians of former glory.The stoa, unlike many of the buildings of the Agora, was a true public building, with no one official, group, or function claiming priority for its use. It was built and used as a popular hangout, and as such attracted huge crowds and those whose business required an audience: jugglers, sword-swallowers, beggars, and fire-eaters. Among those who plied their trade in the building were the philosophers of Athens, in particular Zeno, who came to Athens from Cyprus in ca. 300 B.C. and so preferred the Painted Stoa as his classroom that he and his followers became known as the Stoics.\"Zeno, son of Mnaseas or Demeas of Kition [in Cyprus], a philosopher who began the Stoic school. He was called Stoic because he taught in the stoa at Athens which at an earlier period was called Peisianakteios, but afterwards when painted with pictures received the name Poikile.\" (Suidas)\"Pass on in thought to the Stoa Poikile too -- the memorials of all your great deeds are set up in the Agora.\" (Aischines, vs. Ktesiphon 186)\"Of Polygnotos the painter, a Thasian by birth, son and pupil of Aglaophon, given Athenian citizenship when he painted free of charge the Stoa Poikile. . . .\" (Harpokration)",

They can be restored as a Doric peripteral temple, close in plan, date, and size to the Hephaisteion [5]. Roman masons’ marks carved on the blocks indicate that the temple originally stood elsewhere, was carefully taken apart with all the pieces labelled, and then reerected on the new foundations built for it in the Agora. This is the best example of a phenomenon known as \"wandering temples,\" of which there are several similar examples in the Agora, dating to the early years of the Roman empire. Outstanding examples of Classical architecture were brought in from the outlying villages (demes) of Attica, largely deserted at this period, and reused in downtown Athens, presumably for the worship of deified Roman emperors; it was a relatively cheap and effective way to honor the new order. The probable origin of the Ares temple architecture is the sanctuary of Athena Pallenis (at modern Stavro), where large foundations for a temple have been found but with no trace of any superstructure.

          "Overlooking the Agora from the hill to the west (Kolonos Agoraios), is the Hephaisteion, the best preserved example of a Doric temple in mainland Greece (Fig. 12). It was dedicated jointly to Hephaistos (god of the forge, the Roman Vulcan) and Athena (goddess of arts and crafts), and dates to the second half of the 5th century B.C. It is built largely of Pentelic marble and carries a lavish amount of sculptural decoration. The Labors of Herakles occupy the east facade, while the labors of Theseus adorn short sections of the long north and south sides. The Theseus scenes gave rise to the popular name of the temple, the \"Theseion,\" which survives in the name of the district of the modern city and the nearby Metro stop. Battle scenes surmount the east and west porches, with a lively centauromachy at the west. The two bronze cult statues, done by Alkamenes and described by Pausanias, disappeared long ago. Traces of a garden planted around the temple in the 3rd century B.C. were found in the excavations. Figure 12. The Hephaisteion (\"Theseion\"), seen from across the Agora, ca. 460–415 B.C.  Figure 13. Plan of the Hephaisteion, showing also the conversion of the temple into the Church of St. George, 7th century A.C.  The building owes its remarkable state of preservation to two factors: Athens is not in a major earthquake zone, and the temple was converted into a Christian church in the 7th century A.D. (Fig. 13), saving it from later quarrying for building material, though deep depressions in the steps show where the lead used to seal metal clamps was gouged out. Conversion to a church led to the deliberate mutilation of the sculptures, except for the minotaur at the southeast corner who has retained his head. In the early 19th century the church was used as the Protestant cemetery, and many European philhellenes who died in the War of Independence were buried here.",

          "The south half of the west side was given over to the major administrative buildings used to run the Athenian democracy (Fig. 14). The buildings are poorly preserved, but the identifications are secure thanks to the account of the traveler Pausanias, who visited Athens in the years around A.D. 150. Figure 14. Plan of the administrative buildings at the south end of the west side of the Agora.  The Tholos, recognizable by its round shape, served as the headquarters of the prytaneis (executive committee) of the boule (senate of 500), according to Aristotle (Ath. Pol. 43.3). Here the fifty senators were fed at public expense, and at least seventeen spent the night in the building, available to deal with any emergency, whatever the hour. In a sense, then, the Tholos represents the heart of the Athenian democracy, where citizens serving as senators could be found on duty twenty-four hours a day. Figure 15. Model of the Tholos, ca. 470 B.C.; dining hall and the headquarters of the prytaneis (executive committee of the senate).  Built around 470 B.C., the building was an unadorned drum, with six interior columns supporting a conical roof of large diamond-shape terracotta roof tiles (Fig. 15). The round form of the building is ill-suited for its primary function as a dining-hall and it may be that the usual Greek practice of reclining on couches during meals was abandoned here in favor of sitting on a simple bench. Wine jars and cups labeled as public property were found around the building (Fig. 16). Figure 16. Public dining ware found near the Tholos, 5th century B.C .
